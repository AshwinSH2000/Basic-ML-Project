# Basic-ML-Project

This is the code for the final project of course 'Machine Learning with python' offered by IBM.

The objectives of this project was to load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean it, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. The following algorithms were used:
- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass
